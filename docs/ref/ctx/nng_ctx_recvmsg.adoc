## nng_ctx_recvmsg

Receive message using context.

### Synopsis

```c
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_ctx_recvmsg(nng_ctx ctx, nng_msg **msgp, int flags);
```

### Description

The `nng_ctx_recvmsg` receives a message on context _ctx_, storing the received xref:../msg/index.adoc[message] at the location pointed to by _msgp_.

The _flags_ may contain the following value:

`NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK`::
  The function returns immediately, even if no message is available.
  Without this flag, the function will wait until a message is receivable on the context _ctx_, or any configured timer expires.

TIP: The semantics of what receiving a message means vary from protocol to protocol, so examination of the protocol documentation is encouraged.

### Return Values

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

### Errors

[horizontal]
`NNG_EAGAIN`:: The operation would block, but `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK` was specified.
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The context or socket is not open.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: An invalid set of _flags_ was specified.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available.
`NNG_ENOTSUP`:: The protocol does not support receiving.
`NNG_ESTATE`:: The context cannot receive data in this state.
