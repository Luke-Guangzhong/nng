## nng_version

Report library version.

### Synopsis

```c
#include <nng/nng.h>

const char * nng_version(void);
```

### Description

The `nng_version` function returns a human readable ((version number)) string for _NNG_.footnote:[This version string is meant for human consumption and should not be used progammatically.]

Additionally, compile time version information is available via the following predefined macros:

[horizontal]
((`NNG_MAJOR_VERSION`)):: Major version number.
((`NNG_MINOR_VERSION`)):: Minor version number.
((`NNG_PATCH_VERSION`)):: Patch version number.

_NNG_ is developed and released using http://www.semver.org[Semantic Versioning 2.0], and the version numbers reported refer to both the API and the library itself.footnote:[The ((ABI)) -- ((application binary interface)) -- between the library and the application is controlled in a similar, but different manner depending upon the link options and how the library is built.]

### Return Values

Zero-terminated string containing the library version number.
