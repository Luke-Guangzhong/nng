## nng_mtx_unlock

Unlock mutex.

### Synopsis

```c
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/util/platform.h>

void nng_mtx_unlock(nng_mtx *mtx);
```

### Description

The `nng_mtx_unlock` relinquishes ownership of the mutex _mtx_ that was previously acquired via xref:nng_mtx_lock.adoc[`nng_mtx_lock`].

IMPORTANT: A mutex can _only_ be unlocked by the thread that locked it.
Attempting to unlock a mutex that is not owned by the caller will result in undefined behavior.
