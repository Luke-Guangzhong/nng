## nng_thread_set_name

Set thread name.

### Synopsis

```c
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/util/platform.h>

void nng_thread_set_name(nng_thread *thread, const char *name);
```

### Description

The `nng_thread_set_name` function attempts to set the name for the _thread_ to _name_.

If _thread_ is `NULL`, then the name is set for the calling thread.

Support for this, and how names are exposed, varies between platform implementations.
This function is intended to facilitate debugging applications that have many threads.

TIP: Internal threads created by _NNG_ will have names beginning with `nng:`.
