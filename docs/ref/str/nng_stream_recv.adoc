## nng_stream_recv

Receive from byte stream.

### Synopsis

```c
#include <nng/nng.h>

void nng_stream_recv(nng_stream *s, nng_aio *aio);
```

### Description

The `nng_stream_recv` function starts an asynchronous receive from the byte stream _s_ into the scatter/gather vector located in the asynchronous I/O structure _aio_.

NOTE: The xref:../aio/nng_aio_set_iov.adoc[`nng_aio_set_iov`] function must have been called first, to set the scatter/gather vector for _aio_.

This function returns immediately, with no return value.
Completion of the operation is signaled via the _aio_, and the final result may be obtained via xref:nng_aio_result.adoc[`nng_aio_result`].
That result will either be zero or an error code.

The I/O operation completes as soon as at least one byte has been received, or an error has occurred.
Therefore, the number of bytes read may be less than requested.
The actual number of bytes read can be determined with xref:../aio/nng_aio_count.adoc[`nng_aio_count`].

### Errors

[horizontal]
`NNG_ECANCELED`:: The operation was canceled.
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The connection was closed.
`NNG_ECONNRESET`:: The peer closed the connection.
`NNG_ECONNSHUT`:: Remote peer shutdown after sending data.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: The _aio_ does not contain a valid scatter/gather vector.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient free memory to perform the operation.
`NNG_ETIMEDOUT`:: Timeout waiting for data from the connection.
