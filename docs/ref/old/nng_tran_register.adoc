## nng_tran_register (deprecated)

Register transport.

### Synopsis

```c
int nng_inproc_register(void);
int nng_ipc_register(void);
int nng_tcp_register(void);
int nng_tls_register(void);
int nng_ws_register(void);
int nng_wss_register(void);
int nng_zt_register(void);
```

### Description

These functions are deprecated.
They will initialize the library if not already initialized, but perform no other useful function.
They provided for compatibility, but may be removed in a future release.footnote:[If the library was built with ((`NNG_ELIDE_DEPRECATED`)) then these functions will not be present.
Functions referring to a transport will also not be present if the corresponding transport was not configured when the library was built.]

Formerly they were used to register transports for use, but this is no longer necessary.

### Return Values

These function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

### Errors

[horizontal]
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory to initialize the library.
